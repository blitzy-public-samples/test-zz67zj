## Secure Coding Practices

### Code Security Standards
- All code must pass automated security scanning before deployment
- Regular code reviews with security focus
- Mandatory security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependencies must be from approved sources and regularly updated

### Security Controls
- Input validation on all user-supplied data
- Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks
- Prepared statements for database queries
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt (v5.1.0)
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management (jsonwebtoken v9.0.0)

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Mechanisms
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- JWT-based session management with 1-hour expiration
- Secure password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Password history enforcement
  - Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Session management with secure timeout policies
