# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Executive Summary

The Dog Walker Booking mobile application is a comprehensive platform designed to connect dog owners with professional dog walkers through an on-demand service model. This solution addresses the growing need for flexible pet care services in urban environments where pet owners face time constraints in providing regular exercise for their dogs. The platform serves two primary user groups: busy dog owners seeking reliable walking services and verified dog walkers looking to monetize their services.

The system will revolutionize the pet care industry by providing real-time booking capabilities, secure payment processing, and live walk tracking, while ensuring safety through comprehensive walker verification processes. This solution is expected to capture significant market share in the $1.5B dog walking industry by offering superior convenience, transparency, and trust compared to traditional service models.
